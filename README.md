# Talent Academy West Friesland

## Description
Too many students are leaving the region Noord-Holland-Noord and the Talent Academy West Fries- land has no baseline assessment of the student-job market relation, to measure their success on student retention in the region.

The primary objective of our project was to make a dashboard to help TAWF visualize its progress in a manner that is presentable to third parties.
